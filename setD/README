This is slightly more complicated to implement. In your protein.itp:
- backbone particles of charged and polar (Arg, Lys, Glu, Asp, Asn, Gln) residues are changed to S-type.
        Charged beads at charged termini remain normal.
- polar and charged (P-type and Q-type) beads are changed to p-type.
- small side chains (Cys, Thr, Ser) are changed to S-type.
- include the eps035.itp in your topology.
