This set requires a bit more manual work: 
In your protein.itp:
- Backbone beads are changed to S-type: P5 becomes SP5, C3 becomes SC3
        One exception are the Q-type beads for charged termini.
- Uncharged side chain beads Cysteine, Serine and Lysine are charnged to S-type.
        The second, charged side chain bead of Lysine remains normal
